# Twitter Natural Language Process

This project aims to conduct NLP analysis on tweets generated during the Russia-Ukraine war, providing insights into public opinions and attitudes towards the conflict. A comprehensive set of techniques, including summary statistics, word cloud analysis, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis, was employed to achieve a thorough understanding of the data.
After exploring various tools and libraries, we decided to utilize a Python library called "Snscrape" for our project. This library serves as a scrapper for social networking services (SNS), and notably, it allows us to extract data from Twitter without relying on the Twitter API.
 
We performed topic modeling using NMF and LDA methodologies. In this case, the NMF model is superior to LDA.
Sentiment about the war is reflected by term frequency and tone.
I. Negative > Neutral > Positive
II. Russia tweets reflect more proactive action words and feelings about the war
III. Ukraine tweets reflect a more defensive and reactive feeling about the war
